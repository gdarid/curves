# Curves

Curves is a Python tool used for generating images (with curves)

There is a streamlit application here : [Curves](https://gdarid-curves.streamlit.app/)

This tool is inspired from [Lindenmayer Systems.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system)

You may add your own new curves in the YAML file "curves_parmeters.yaml"


## Setup Instructions

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Streamlit application

The streamlit application can be launched locally

# Curves

Curves is a Python tool used for generating images with L-systems

There is a streamlit application here : [Curves](https://gdarid-curves.streamlit.app/)

This tool is inspired from [Lindenmayer Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system)

Other interesting tools : 

- [L-System generator](https://onlinemathtools.com/l-system-generator)
- [Turtletoy](https://turtletoy.net/) 


## Setup Instructions

Install required Python modules with pip (or pip3)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You may add your own new curves in the YAML file "curves_parmeters.yaml"

## Streamlit application

The streamlit application can be launched locally

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

## Notes

This project is an ongoing personal project with documentation and redesign currently in progress
